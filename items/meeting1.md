## Meeting Minutes
- [Summary of the progress reports, discussions, decisions, and matters to be confirmed from the meeting.]
- Inception deck (10 Questions). Everyone is on the same page in terms of commitment and expectations
- Conflict resolution protocol: 
  1. Not finishing assigned work (whatever the reason) : 
     A. Valid reason: Let the group know asap so that other members can fill in, or at least be aware.
     B. Invalid reason: Ask if everything is alright (Hard task, Not fully understood), then ask for a game plan for the week.
        If that doesn't work, talk to Sergio
  2. Disagreement on coding practices : Post a gitlab issue, then discuss and come to an agreement.
- Team policy: healthy time allocation such that we can get enough mark for the grade
- Development policy: We agreed to program a readable code (e.g. descriptive method/variable name, comment in English).
- Product design: We decided to develop a simple twitter (X) clone
