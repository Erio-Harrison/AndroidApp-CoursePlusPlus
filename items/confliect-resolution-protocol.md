# Conflict resolution protocol: 
 1. Not finishing assigned work (whatever the reason) : 
    A. Valid reason: Let the group know asap so that other members can fill in, or at least be aware.
    B. Invalid reason: Ask if everything is alright (Hard task, Not fully understood), then ask for a game plan for the week.
        If that doesn't work, talk to Sergio
 2. Disagreement on coding practices : Post a gitlab issue, then discuss and come to an agreement.
